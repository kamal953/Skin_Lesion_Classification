# Skin_Lesion_Classification

# 🧠 Skin Lesion Classification – Team Syberthon

This repository contains my submission for the Skin Lesion Classification Challenge, where I built a CNN-based model to classify skin lesions into 8 diagnostic categories.

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

- **Task**: Predict skin lesion categories from image data
- **Dataset**: Medical images (not included due to size constraints)
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Score**: Achieved 0.33005 on the leaderboard

## 📁 What's Included

- `skin_lesion_classifier.ipynb`: My full training and inference notebook
- `submission.csv`: Final predictions for the test set
- `README.md`: Project overview and learnings

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Built my first CNN for medical image classification
- Learned image preprocessing, data augmentation, and evaluation metrics
- Gained experience with Kaggle workflows and submission formats

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📦 Dataset Access

Due to size constraints, the full dataset is not included in this repo.
